# FTP-Connector
This Python script connects to an FTP server using provided credentials, navigates to a specified directory (if given), and retrieves a list of files. 
It then filters the files based on a given prefix and downloads the matching ones to a local directory. 
The script ensures proper error handling and prints status messages throughout the process, including connection status, found files, and successful downloads.
